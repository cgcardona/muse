"""Domain schema declaration types — Phases 2 and 4.

A plugin implements :meth:`~muse.domain.MuseDomainPlugin.schema` returning a
:class:`DomainSchema` to declare the structural shape of its data. The core
engine uses this declaration to:

1. Select the correct diff algorithm for each dimension via
   :func:`~muse.core.diff_algorithms.diff_by_schema`.
2. Provide informed conflict messages (citing dimension names) in Phase 3.
3. Route to CRDT merge when ``merge_mode`` is ``"crdt"`` in Phase 4.

Every schema type is a ``TypedDict`` — JSON-serialisable, zero-``Any``, and
verifiable by mypy in strict mode.

Phase 4 additions
-----------------
:class:`CRDTDimensionSpec` declares which CRDT primitive a dimension uses when
``DomainSchema.merge_mode`` is ``"crdt"``.  Plugins that mix three-way and
CRDT semantics per-dimension use :class:`CRDTDimensionSpec` for their CRDT
dimensions and :class:`DimensionSpec` for their three-way dimensions; both are
listed in :class:`DomainSchema`.

Design note on ``MapSchema.value_schema``
-----------------------------------------
``MapSchema.value_schema`` carries the type ``ElementSchema``, which is
defined *after* ``MapSchema`` in this file. With ``from __future__ import
annotations`` all annotations are evaluated lazily, so this forward reference
is resolved correctly by both the Python runtime and mypy.
