"""Muse Motif Engine — identify, track, and compare recurring melodic motifs.

A *motif* is a short melodic or rhythmic idea — a sequence of pitches and/or
durations — that reappears and transforms throughout a composition. This
module implements the core analysis engine used by ``muse motif find``,
``muse motif track``, and ``muse motif diff``.

Design
------
- Melodic identity is encoded as **interval sequences** (signed semitone
  differences between consecutive pitches) so that transpositions of the same
  motif hash to the same fingerprint.
- Rhythmic identity is encoded as **relative duration ratios** normalised
  against the shortest note in the sequence so that augmented / diminished
  versions are detectable.
- A motif fingerprint is the concatenation of its interval sequence, allowing
  fast set-based matching across commits.
- Transformation detection (inversion, retrograde, augmentation, diminution)
  compares the found fingerprint against the query fingerprint's variants.

Boundary rules
--------------
- Must NOT import StateStore, executor, MCP tools, or route handlers.
- May import ``muse_cli.{db, models}``.
- Pure helpers (fingerprint computation, transformation detection) are
  synchronous and fully testable without a DB.
