"""muse resolve — mark a conflicted file as resolved.

Workflow
--------
When ``muse merge`` encounters conflicts it writes ``.muse/MERGE_STATE.json``
and exits. The user then inspects the listed conflict paths and resolves each
one:

- ``--ours``: Keep the current branch's version already in ``muse-work/``.
                The file is left untouched; the path is removed from the conflict
                list in ``MERGE_STATE.json``.

- ``--theirs``: Accept the incoming branch's version. This command fetches
                the object from the local store (written when the other branch's
                commits were made) and writes it to ``muse-work/<path>`` before
                removing the path from the conflict list.

After resolving each conflict, run ``muse merge --continue`` to create the
merge commit.

Resolution strategies
---------------------
Both strategies ultimately remove the path from ``conflict_paths`` in
``MERGE_STATE.json``. When the list reaches zero, ``muse merge --continue``
can proceed.

The ``--theirs`` strategy requires the theirs commit's objects to be present
in the local ``.muse/objects/`` store. Objects are written there when commits
are made locally; ``muse pull`` fetches them from the remote.

                   accept theirs (object is fetched from local store and written
