"""muse revert — create a new commit that undoes a prior commit.

Safe undo: given a commit C with parent P, ``muse revert <commit>`` creates
a new commit whose snapshot is P's state (the world before C was applied).
History is never rewritten — the revert is a forward commit.

Domain analogy: a producer accidentally committed a bad drum arrangement.
Rather than resetting (which loses history), ``muse revert`` creates an
"undo commit" so the full timeline remains auditable.

Flags
-----
COMMIT TEXT Commit ID to revert (required, positional, accepts prefix).
--no-commit Apply the inverse changes to muse-work/ without committing.
--track TEXT Scope the revert to paths under tracks/<track>/.
--section TEXT Scope the revert to paths under sections/<section>/.
