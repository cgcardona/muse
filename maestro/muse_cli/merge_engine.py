"""Muse VCS merge engine — fast-forward and 3-way path-level merge.

Public API
----------
Pure functions (no I/O):

- :func:`diff_snapshots` — paths that changed between two snapshot manifests.
- :func:`detect_conflicts` — paths changed on *both* branches since the base.
- :func:`apply_merge` — build merged manifest for a conflict-free 3-way merge.

Async helpers (require a DB session):

- :func:`find_merge_base` — lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two commits.

Filesystem helpers:

- :func:`read_merge_state` — detect and load an in-progress merge.
- :func:`write_merge_state` — persist conflict state before exiting.
