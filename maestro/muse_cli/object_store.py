"""Canonical content-addressed object store for the Muse VCS.

All Muse commands that read or write blobs — ``muse commit``, ``muse read-tree``,
``muse reset`` — go through this module exclusively. No command may implement
its own path logic or copy its own blobs.

Layout
------
Objects are stored under ``<repo_root>/.muse/objects/`` using a two-character
sharded directory layout that mirrors Git's loose-object format::

    .muse/objects/<sha2>/<sha62>

where ``<sha2>`` is the first two hex characters of the SHA-256 digest and
``<sha62>`` is the remaining 62 characters. For example, the object with
digest ``ab1234...`` is stored at ``.muse/objects/ab/1234...``.

Why sharding?
-------------
Music repositories accumulate objects at a far higher rate than code
repositories: every generated take, every variation, every rendered clip is a
new blob. A single recording session can produce tens of thousands of objects.
Without sharding, a flat directory exceeds filesystem limits (ext4, APFS, HFS+
all degrade or hard-limit above ~32,000 entries per directory). Two hex
characters yield 256 subdirectories — the same trade-off Git settled on after
years of production use.

This module is the single source of truth for all local object I/O.
The store is append-only: writing the same object twice is always a no-op.
