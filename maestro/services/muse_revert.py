"""Muse Revert Service — create a new commit that undoes a prior commit.

Revert is the safe undo: given a target commit C with parent P, it creates
a new commit whose snapshot is P's snapshot (the state before C was applied).
History is preserved — no commit is deleted or rewritten.

For path-scoped reverts (--track, --section), only paths matching the filter
prefix are reverted to P's state; all other paths remain at HEAD's state.

Boundary rules:
  - Must NOT import StateStore, EntityRegistry, or get_or_create_store.
  - Must NOT import executor modules or maestro_* handlers.
  - May import muse_cli.db, muse_cli.models, muse_cli.merge_engine,
    muse_cli.snapshot.

Domain analogy: a producer accidentally committed a bad drum arrangement.
``muse revert <commit>`` creates a new "undo commit" so the DAW history
shows what happened and when, rather than silently rewriting the timeline.
