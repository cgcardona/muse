"""Muse bisect service — binary search over the commit graph for regression hunting.

This service implements the state machine and commit graph traversal logic for
``muse bisect``. It is the music-domain analogue of ``git bisect``: given a
known-good commit and a known-bad commit, it finds the first commit that
introduced a regression by binary searching the ancestry path.

Typical music QA workflow
-------------------------
1. ``muse bisect start``
2. ``muse bisect good <last_known_good_sha>``
3. ``muse bisect bad <current_broken_sha>``
4. Muse checks out the midpoint commit into muse-work/ for inspection.
5. Producer listens, runs tests, then ``muse bisect good`` or ``muse bisect bad``.
6. Repeat until the culprit commit is identified.
7. ``muse bisect reset`` restores the pre-bisect state.

``muse bisect run <cmd>`` automates steps 4-6: it runs the command after each
checkout and uses the exit code (0 = good, 1 = bad) to advance automatically.

State file schema (BISECT_STATE.json)
--------------------------------------
.. code-block:: json

    {
        "good": "abc123...",
        "bad": "def456...",
        "current": "789abc...",
        "tested": {"commit_id": "good"},
        "pre_bisect_ref": "refs/heads/main",
        "pre_bisect_commit": "abc000..."
    }

``tested`` is a map from commit_id to verdict (``"good"`` or ``"bad"``).
``pre_bisect_ref`` and ``pre_bisect_commit`` record where HEAD was before the
session started so ``muse bisect reset`` can cleanly restore the workspace.
