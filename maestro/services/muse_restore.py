"""Muse Restore Service — restore specific files from a commit or index.

``muse restore`` is surgical: restore one instrument track from a specific
commit while keeping everything else at HEAD. Critical for music production
where you want "the bass from take 3, everything else from take 7."

Restore modes
-------------
**worktree** (default, ``--worktree``)
    Copy the file content recorded in the *source* snapshot directly into
    ``muse-work/``. Branch pointer and index are not changed. This is the
    primary use case: "put the bass from take 3 back into my working tree."

**staged** (``--staged``)
    In a full VCS with an explicit staging area this would reset the index
    entry for the path from the source snapshot without touching ``muse-work/``.
    In the current Muse model (no separate staging area) ``--staged`` is
    documented for forward-compatibility and behaves identically to
    ``--worktree``: it restores the file in ``muse-work/`` from the source
    snapshot. When a staging index is added this module will be updated.

**source** (``--source <commit>``)
    Selects which snapshot to extract the file from. Defaults to ``HEAD``
    when omitted.

Object store contract
---------------------
Restore reads objects from ``.muse/objects/`` exactly like ``muse reset
--hard``. If an object is missing, :class:`MissingObjectError` is raised
and ``muse-work/`` is left unchanged (the restore is atomic per path).

This module is a pure service layer — no Typer, no CLI, no StateStore.
Import boundary: may import muse_cli.{db,models,object_store}, muse_reset
(for MissingObjectError and resolve_ref), but NOT executor,
maestro_handlers, mcp, or StateStore.

    Resolves the source commit reference, validates that every requested path

    each file atomically.

    The branch pointer is never modified — only ``muse-work/`` files are written.

    Args:
        root: Muse repository root (directory containing ``.muse/``).
        session: Open async DB session.
        paths: Relative paths within ``muse-work/`` to restore. Must be

                    or bare ``bass/bassline.mid`` — the ``muse-work/`` prefix is
                    stripped if present.

                    or ``None`` for HEAD).
        staged: When ``True``, ``--staged`` mode is active. In the current
                    Muse model (no separate staging area) this is semantically
                    equivalent to ``--worktree``.

        PathNotInSnapshotError: When any requested path is absent from the source.
        MissingObjectError: When a required blob is absent from the object store.
