"""Muse Rebase Service — replay commits onto a new base.

Algorithm
---------
1. Find the merge-base (LCA) of the current branch HEAD and ``<upstream>``.
2. Collect the commits on the current branch that are *not* ancestors of
   ``<upstream>`` (i.e., commits added since the LCA), ordered oldest first.
3. For each such commit, compute the snapshot delta relative to its own parent,
   then apply that delta on top of the current ``onto`` tip (which starts as
   ``<upstream>`` HEAD and advances after each successful replay).
4. Insert a new commit record (new commit_id because the parent has changed).
5. Advance the branch pointer to the final replayed commit.

Because Muse snapshots are content-addressed manifests (``{path: object_id}``),
``apply_delta`` is a pure dict operation — no byte-level merge required.

State file: ``.muse/REBASE_STATE.json``
-----------------------------------------
Written when a conflict is detected mid-replay so ``--continue`` and ``--abort``
can resume or abandon the operation:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "upstream_commit": "abc123...",
        "base_commit": "def456...",
        "original_branch": "feature",
        "original_head": "ghi789...",
        "commits_to_replay": ["cid1", "cid2", "cid3"],
        "current_onto": "abc123...",
        "completed_pairs": [["cid1", "new_cid1"]],
        "current_commit": "cid2",
        "conflict_paths": ["beat.mid"]
    }

Boundary rules:
  - Must NOT import StateStore, EntityRegistry, or get_or_create_store.
  - Must NOT import executor modules or maestro_* handlers.
  - May import muse_cli.db, muse_cli.models, muse_cli.merge_engine,
    muse_cli.snapshot.

Domain analogy: a producer has 10 "fixup" commits from a late-night session.
``muse rebase dev`` replays them cleanly onto the ``dev`` tip, producing a
linear history — the musical narrative stays readable as a sequence of
intentional variations.

    """Run the rebase pipeline.

    All filesystem and DB side-effects are isolated here so tests can inject
    an in-memory SQLite session and a ``tmp_path`` root without touching a
    real database.

    Args:
        upstream: Branch name or commit ID to rebase onto.
        root: Repository root (directory containing ``.muse/``).
        session: Open async DB session.
        interactive: When ``True``, open $EDITOR with the rebase plan before
            executing. The edited plan controls action, order, and squash
            behaviour.
        autosquash: When ``True``, automatically detect ``fixup!`` commits and
            move them after their matching target commit.
        rebase_merges: When ``True``, preserve merge commits during replay
            (stub — see implementation note below).

    Returns:
        :class:`RebaseResult` describing what happened.
