"""Muse Merge Base — find the lowest common ancestor of two variations.

Equivalent to ``git merge-base A B``. Walks both lineages and returns
the closest common ancestor variation_id.

Boundary rules:
  - Must NOT import StateStore, executor, MCP tools, or handlers.
  - May import muse_repository (for lineage queries).
