"""Muse Log Graph — serialize the commit DAG as Swift-ready JSON.

Pure read-only projection layer. Fetches all variations for a project
in a single query, builds the DAG in memory, and performs a stable
topological sort. O(N + E) time complexity.

Boundary rules:
  - Must NOT import StateStore, executor, handlers, LLM code,
    drift engine, merge engine, or checkout modules.
  - May import muse_repository (for bulk queries).
